# 🎭 Multi-Tab Booking Test Results & UI Behavior

## 🧪 What We Tested

### Scenario: Same Seat, Different Tabs

- **User 1 (Tab 1)**: Tries to book Seat A-2
- **User 2 (Tab 2)**: Tries to book Seat A-2 (same seat)
- **Timing**: Both submit requests simultaneously

### Results:

```
🎯 SCENARIO 1: Both tabs try to book the SAME seat
🪑 Target Seat: A-2

📊 Same Seat Booking Results:
✅ One user gets the seat (Redis distributed locking works)
❌ Other user gets error: "Seats are currently being booked by another user"

📊 Capacity: 97 → 96 (correctly decreases by 1)
```

## 🖥️ UI Behavior in Different Tabs

### ✅ **Tab 1 (Successful Booking)**:

1. User clicks "Book Selected Seats"
2. Loading state appears
3. **🎉 Congratulations popup appears**
4. Available capacity updates: "96/100 spots available"
5. Selected seat becomes red (booked)
6. User can download ticket

### ❌ **Tab 2 (Failed Booking)**:

1. User clicks "Book Selected Seats"
2. Loading state appears
3. **❌ Error message appears**: "Seats are currently being booked by another user"
4. **🚫 NO congratulations popup**
5. Seat selection resets
6. Available capacity updates: "96/100 spots available"
7. User can select different seats

## 🔒 Concurrency Protection

### How It Works:

1. **Redis Distributed Lock**: Each seat gets a temporary lock during booking
2. **First Request Wins**: Whoever gets the lock first gets the seat
3. **Queue Processing**: BullMQ ensures ordered processing
4. **Optimistic Locking**: Database version field prevents race conditions

### Error Messages:

- **Seat taken**: "Seats are currently being booked by another user"
- **Event full**: "Only X tickets available"
- **Network error**: "Booking failed, please try again"

## 🎯 Fixed Text Readability Issues

### Before:

- Section names might appear in white text
- VIP/Premium sections hard to read
- Stage text not prominent

### ✅ After:

- Section names: `text-gray-900` (dark text on white background)
- Seat numbers: `text-white` on colored backgrounds (proper contrast)
- Stage indicator: `🎭 STAGE` with white text on dark background
- All text has proper contrast ratios
